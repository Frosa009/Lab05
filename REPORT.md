Being 100% honest I neglected this class assignments because of the fact that I am taking cs 141 for the third time. I had failed twice previously twice already when i 
was working 36 hours a week so i decided to quit my job and take the class for a third time with department approval. The open ended due dates of this class really helped me focus on cs 141 while
still working on these labs if only for a day a week just to get them started. Though I did end up pulling 3 all nighthers to get them done in a reasonable amount of time. It was worth it since now i
I have a decent grade to pass cs 141 with and continue my CE degree without having to worry too much anymore. Thank you for this oppurtunity and I hope they get this class to 4 units cause honestly i learned more abour verilog and architecture here than in cs 161.

ANyways in terms of prelab and current lab I again did not do much to change the test except what was suggested in the lab portion. Other than that not much is reportable in terms of tesing.

THis is my waveform which suprsingly went realtively smooth comapred to the other labs. The other labs i had some issues get gtkwave to load the files but this one went just fine.
